I am a Space Weather Engineer at [SpaceAble](https://spaceable.org/fr/) and holder of a PhD degree from Université Grenoble-Alpes - [IPAG](https://ipag.osug.fr/) (Institut de Planétologie et d'Astrophysique de Grenoble) and [GIPSA-Lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/) (Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique).

**Research**: My research is about applying Machine Learning to model astrophysics phenomena. My PhD was about the study of low-energy electron fluxes in Low Earth Orbit. These electrons, often called *precipitated electrons* are responsible both for beautiful auroras and technical difficulties for in-space systems. Moreover, they are the witness of the solar activity and its impact on our lives. I worked on using Machine Learning technics to forecast the total electron energy fluxes measured by [DMSP](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Meteorological_Satellite_Program) and am still working today on applying AI technics to Space Weather phenomena. 

## About me
I have a diverse academic background ranging from Aerospace Engineering to Astrophysics, Data Science and Philosophy. I started by completing a BSc and MSc at the [Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/) (ISAE-SUPAERO) in France, where I specialized in Design and Operation of Space Systems, Earth Observation, and Sciences of the Universe. I also followed a joint MRes degree with the [Université Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) in Toulouse and graduated in Astrophysics, Space Sciences and Planetology ([ASEP](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/master-parcours-astrophysique-sciences-de-lespace-et-planetologie-asep)) in 2019. During my studies, I spent a year at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and completed an [MSc in Philosophy of Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2023/MSc-Philosophy-of-Science). 

After my studies I moved to Washington DC to join the [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) of NASA. I was working in the [Observational Cosmology Lab](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/astrophysics/cosmology/) on the development of a Bayesian-based model validation framework for large-scale systems. The James Webb Space Telescope has been used as a case study.

Since October 2019, I joined SpaceAble as a Space Weather Engineer. From October 2020 to December 2023, I did a Ph.D. at the Université Grenoble-Alpes in applying Machine Learning technics to model and forecast Space Weather phenomena, under the co-supervision of Mathieu Barthélémy and [Jocelyn Chanussot](https://jocelyn-chanussot.net/) and within two laboratories: the [IPAG](https://ipag.osug.fr/) (Institut de Planétologie et d'Astrophysique de Grenoble) and [GIPSA-Lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/) (Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique).
